# Pull Request Check List

This checklist serves as a guid for contributors and maintainers to assess
whether a contribution can be merged into the master branch and thus serves
to guarantee the quality of the package. Please also read the
[contribution guidline](https://github.com/tempoCollaboration/TimeEvolvingMPO/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Before you submit a pull request, please go through this checklist once
more, as it will decrease the number of unnecessary review cycles.
However, this list is there to *help* all contributors to produce high
quality code, not to deter you from contributing. If you can't tick some of the
boxes, feel free to submit the pull request anyway and report about it in the
pull request message.

Some of the boxes might not apply to the specific type of your contribution. In
this case you can consider the particular box as checked.
